# Movies-ETL

## Overview of Project
Amazing Prime loves the dataset and wants to keep it updated on a daily basis. Britta needs your help to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. You’ll need to refactor the code from this module to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

## Results
We've pulled together data from Wikipedia, Kaggle and MovieLens rating data and joined it all together into one database using our best judgement to filter out anything not relevant. We ended up with 6,052 movies and 26,024,289 ratings
